Advent of Code
==============

For the uninitiated, [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of
programming challenges, a new one is released each day until Dec. 25th.

Each challenge requires thinking in a different way to solve it, and for this
reason I love to use these sorts of problems to learn how different programming
languages idiomatically approach each solution. You'll notice that in any given
situation, the idiomatic Python way of solving something will be very different
from the Haskell or Lisp way of doing things.

So let's collect code samples from as many languages as we can to see how things
are done!

Guidelines
----------

-   If you have solutions to contribute in a language, please submit them in a
    pull-request and I'll get to them as soon as I can.
-   Please don't include your problem's 'input.txt' or solution, as these are
    different for each person.
-   Please put each solution (including part 1 and part 2) into separate files
    (even if there's a bit of code duplication) it makes it easier to figure out
    what's going on.
-   Please try to write clean code solutions in your language of choice, and
    remember that this is about seeing different ways that languages approach
    things, so if a particular language feature or idiom applies nicely to the
    situation, make sure to include it!
-   The goal of this is to be easy to read, so include comments and avoid using
    multiple files and using complicated build steps unless necessary.
-   I'm not an expert, so if you see improvements that could be made to a
    solution in the repository, feel free to submit a pull request to clean it
    up, but keep in mind that if it's a trivial difference, or is simply
    personal preference, it may be ignored.
-   In pull requests please follow the established pattern:
  + `language-name/day-num/part#.extension`
-   How will we decide what the optimal solution is?
  + For now I'm just accepting solutions as they come in, if someone can
    demonstrate that their solution is either more idiomatic to the language or 
    is significantly cleaner, then we'll switch it in. Keep in mind that it's
    about seeing how idioms differ amongst different languages, not necessarily 
    about getting the most optimal solution. Let's not get competitive about it.


Have fun!!
