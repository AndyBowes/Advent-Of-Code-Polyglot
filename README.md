Advent of Code
==============

For the uninitiated, [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of
programming challenges, a new one is released each day until Dec. 25th.

Each challenge requires thinking in a different way to solve it, and for this
reason I love to use these sorts of problems to learn how different programming
languages idiomatically approach each solution. You'll notice that in any given
situation, the idiomatic Python way of solving something will be very different
from the Haskell or Lisp way of doing things.

So let's collect code samples from as many languages as we can to see how things
are done!

Guidelines
----------

-   If you have solutions to contribute in a language, please submit them in a
    pull-request and I'll get to them as soon as I can.
-   Please don't include your problem's 'input.txt' or solution, as these are
    different for each person.
-   Please try to write clean code solutions in your language of choice, and
    remember that this is about seeing different ways that languages approach
    things, so if a particular language feature or idiom applies nicely to the
    situation, make sure to include it!
-   The goal of this is to be easy to read, so include comments and avoid using
    multiple files and using complicated build steps unless necessary.
-   I'm not an expert in every language, so if you see improvements that could
    be made to a solution in the repository, feel free to submit a pull request
    to clean it up, but keep in mind that if it's a trivial difference, or is
    simply personal preference, it may be ignored.
-   No code will be posted for a challenge until the next challenge is
    released, let's give people a chance to solve things on their own.


Have fun!!
